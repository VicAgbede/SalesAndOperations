# SalesAndOperations
In this project, sales and operations planning was simulated using the zero stock level strategy. 
The python program asks the user to enter the following data:
> An initial stock level for a product
> The number of month(s) to plan 
> The planned sales quantity for each month 

Based on these data, the required product quantity is calculated as folows:
> If the sales quantity is smaller than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is 0
> If the sales quantity is larger than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is this difference
